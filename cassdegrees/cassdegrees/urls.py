"""cassdegrees URL Configuration

The `urlpatterns` list routes URLs to views. For more information please see:

Examples:
Function views
    1. Add an import:  from my_app import views
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', views.home, name='home')
Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', Home.as_view(), name='home')
Including another URLconf
    1. Import the include() function: from django.urls import include, path
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('blog/', include('blog.urls'))
"""
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    # Try commenting and uncommenting this to see the changes in the interface!
    # when this is uncommented, Django will instead redirect traffic to our index.html
    # (take a peek in ui/urls.py and ui/views.py)
    # path('', include('ui.urls')),
]
